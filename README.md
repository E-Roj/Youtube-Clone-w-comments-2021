# Youtube-Clone-w-comments-2021
A main HOMEPAGE clone of youtube.com (or youtu.be) created following a tutorial and it's on Version 1.0 + inclues responsive design!
This clone conisists of CSS and HTML and does NOT inclue JS.

The status of this project is INCOMPLETE, as it lacks or suffers from:
 1. missing couple of the video-cards (video-previews in my code) that were in the tutorial.
 2. missing links
 3. missing header tooltips
 4. having repetitive code

Notes | 
* The title mentions the year 2021, however the project's first version was created and finished in the fiscal year 2022. The reason being to not to misslead you into believing this is clone is one of the letest youtube clones on github.
* the link for the tutorial is ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc&ab_channel=SuperSimpleDev ).


Hope this will benefit you.
